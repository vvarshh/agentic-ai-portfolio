# Agentic AI Portfolio

This repository contains my personal projects focused on **Agentic AI**, automation, workflows, and product-thinking.  
It showcases the systems I’m building to automate daily life, streamline information, and design practical AI-driven tools.

The goal:  
**Demonstrate end-to-end Agentic AI reasoning, automation design, and product execution** — the exact skillset needed for next-gen AI Product Manager roles.
